# LCD Preview Components Glossary

## UI Elements

### LCD Display
- `lcdCanvas` - The main HTML canvas element where all display content is rendered
- `ctx` - The 2D rendering context for the canvas

### Navigation Controls
- `prevButton` - Button to go to the previous state
- `nextButton` - Button to go to the next state
- `flowSelect` - Dropdown to select different display flows
- `powerButton` - Button to simulate the device power button
- `ledLight` - LED indicator that changes color/state based on device status

### Other UI Elements
- `explanationText` - Text description of the current state
- `currentStepSpan` - Displays the current step number
- `totalStepsSpan` - Displays the total number of steps in the current flow
- `cable` - HTML element representing the charging cable

## Core Display Mechanisms

### Flow Management
- `flows` - Object containing all display state flows (power, binding, firmware update, etc.)
- `currentFlow` - Current active flow (string identifier)
- `currentStateIndex` - Index of the current state within the active flow
- `updateDisplay()` - Main function to update the display with the current state

### Animation System
- `onEnter()` - Method that initializes animations for a state
- `currentAnimation` - Reference to the current running animation
- `requestAnimationFrame()` - Browser API used for smooth animations

## Common UI Components

### Battery Display
- `drawBattery(ctx, level)` - Function to draw battery at specified level (0-100)
- `drawAnimatedBattery(ctx, frame, options)` - Enhanced battery with animation and customization options

### Connection Indicators
- `drawWifiStatus(ctx, status, frame, isFullHeight)` - Draws WiFi connection status (searching, connecting, connected)
- `connectionState` - Global variable tracking current connection state ('searching', 'connecting', 'connected')

### Power Controls
- `drawPowerButtonAnimation(ctx, frame, isOff)` - Animates power button with bouncing arrow
- `drawShutdownCountdown(ctx, remainingTime)` - Shows shutdown countdown timer
- `isPowerButtonPressed` - Boolean tracking if power button is currently pressed
- `isPoweredOff` - Boolean tracking if device is powered off
- `isShuttingDown` - Boolean tracking if device is in shutdown process
- `shutdownStartTime` - Timestamp when shutdown was initiated
- `SHUTDOWN_HOLD_TIME` - Constant for how long power button must be held (2000ms)

### Cable Charging
- `isCableVisible` - Boolean tracking if charging cable is visible
- `updateCableVisibility(visible)` - Function to show/hide the charging cable
- `isChargerConnected` - Boolean tracking if charger is connected

### Device Orientation
- `rollDegrees` - Roll angle in degrees
- `pitchDegrees` - Pitch angle in degrees
- `rollExaggerationFactor` - Multiplier for roll angle display (3x)
- `pitchExaggerationFactor` - Multiplier for pitch angle display (6x)
- `drawAttitudeIndicator(ctx, roll, pitch)` - Draws attitude indicator with specified angles

### Success Animation
- `drawSuccessAnimation(ctx, frame)` - Draws success animation with green checkmark

## Flow-Specific Components

### Power Flow
- `Off` - Device is powered off state
- `Power On` - Device is powering on with logo fade in
- `On` - Device is powered on and searching for connection
- `Fully On` - Device is fully powered on and connected
- `Shutdown` - Device is in shutdown sequence
- `Shutdown Complete` - Device has been powered off

### Binding Flow
- `Linking Ready` - Device is ready to be linked to account
- `Linking in Progress` - Device is being linked to account
- `Linking Complete` - Device has been successfully linked

### Firmware Update Flow
- `Firmware Update, connect charger` - Initial state before update
- `Update Ready` - Firmware update ready to start
- `Updating` - Firmware update in progress
- `Update Complete` - Firmware update completed successfully
- `Restarting` - Device is restarting after update
- `Charger Disconnected` - Error state when charger is removed during update
- `Update Failed` - Error state when update fails
- `updateProgress` - Global variable tracking firmware update progress (0-1)

### Levelling Flow
- `Attitude Indicator v2/v3/v4` - Different versions of the attitude indicator display
- `isJoystickActive` - Boolean tracking if joystick control is active
- `initJoystick()` - Function to initialize joystick controls

### Error States Flow
- Various error screens (System Error, Critical Error, Error E001, etc.)

### Battery Status Flow
- `Battery Normal` - Normal battery level
- `Battery Low` - Low battery warning
- `Battery Critical` - Critical battery warning

### Cable Charging Flow
- `Connect cable` - Initial cable connection animation
- `Animated Battery 2` - Battery charging animation
- `Battery Fully Charged` - Battery at 100% while charging
- `Cable Disconnect` - Cable disconnection animation

## Utility Functions

- `toTitleCase(str)` - Converts strings to title case for display
- `populateFlowSelect()` - Populates the flow selection dropdown
- `startPowerOn()` - Initiates power on sequence
- `startShutdownCountdown()` - Initiates shutdown sequence
- `cancelShutdown()` - Cancels shutdown if button released early
- `updateFirmwareProgress(progress)` - Updates firmware progress from external source

## Assets

- `microQRImg` - QR code image for binding flow
- `microQRImgLoaded` - Boolean tracking if QR code image has loaded
- `showSerialNumber` - Boolean to toggle between QR code and serial number in binding ready state
